it has traditionally came with just a single filter, known as
'shuffle', meant for shuffling bytes in binary blocks.  Today this has
changed, and c-blosc has officially received a new filter called
'bitshuffle' (a backport of the one included in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kiyo-masui/bitshuffle"&gt;bithsuffle project&lt;/a&gt;).
And you guess it, it works in a very similar way than
'shuffle', just that the shuffling happens at the bit level and not at
the byte one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for whetting your appetite here there are some small synthetic
benchmarks on what you can expect from the newcomer.  I'll start using
my own laptop (Intel i5-3380M @ 2.90GHz, GCC 4.9.1, Ubuntu 14.10) and
showing how the benchmark that comes with c-blosc performs with the
LZ4 compressor and the regular 'shuffle' filter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing! the compression ratios are much higher (up to 83x vs 16x)
which is very exciting.  The drawback is that with 'bitshuffle' the
compression/decompression speed is between 2x and 4x slower than with
the regular 'shuffle'.  In fact, this slowdown is unusually light
because the additional work should be much more (1 byte has 8 bits),
so that's not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have some good news: besides SSE2, 'bitshuffle' also supports
AVX2 SIMD instructions (as 'shuffle' itself) but unfortunately my
laptop does not have them (pre-Haswell).  So let's run the benchmark
above in a AVX2 server (Intel Xeon E3-1240 v3 @ 3.40GHz, GCC 4.9.3,
Gentoo 2.2):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, in this case we are having compression speed peaks even higher
than a memcpy (8 GB/s vs 7.5 GB/s), and decompression speed is pretty
good too (8.8 GB/s vs 11.5 GB/s memcpy).  With AVX2 support,
'bitshuffle' does have a pretty good performance.  But yeah, this
server has 8 physical cores, so we are not actually comparing pears
with pears.  So let's re-run the benchmark with just 2 threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for 2 threads we are getting times that are about 2x slower than
for 8 threads.  But the interesting thing here is that the compression
speed is still ~2x faster than my laptop (peaks at 3.7 GB/s vs 1.8
GB/s) and the same goes for decompression (peaks at 5 GB/s vs 2.4
GB/s).  Agreed, the server can run at 3.4GHz vs 2.9 GHz of my laptop,
but this alone cannot explain the difference in speed, so the big
responsible for the speedup is the AVX2 support in 'bitshuffle'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the new 'bitshuffle' filter is very good news for the
users of the Blosc ecosystem because it adds yet another powerful
resource that will help in the fight for storing datasets with less
space, but still keeping good performance.  Of course, this is just a
quick experiment with synthetic data, but I am pretty sure that the
new 'bitshuffle' filter will find a good niche in real world datasets.
Anyone interested in contributing some real data benchmark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank Kiyo Masui for his help in this 'bitshuffle' backport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>blosc</category><category>filters</category><guid>http://blosc.org/posts/new-bitshuffle-filter/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 15:24:20 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
