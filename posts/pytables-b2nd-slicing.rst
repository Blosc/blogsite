The recent and long-awaited PyTables 3.9 release carries many goodies, including a particular one which makes us at the PyTables and Blosc teams very excited: optimized HDF5 hyper-slicing that leverages the double partition schema in Blosc2 NDim. This development was funded by a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`_ grant and the Blosc project.

I (Ivan) carried on with the work that Marta started, with very valuable help from her and Francesc. I was in fact a core PyTables developer quite a few years ago (2004-2008) while working with Francesc and Vicent at CÃ¡rabos Coop. V. (see the `20 year anniversary post <https://www.blosc.org/posts/pytables-20years/>`_ for more info), and it was an honour and a pleasure to be back at the project. It took me a while to get back to grips with development, but it was a nice surprise to see the code that we worked so hard upon live through the years and get better and more popular. My heartfelt thanks to everybody who made that possible!
