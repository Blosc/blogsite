The recent and long-awaited PyTables 3.9 release carries many goodies, including a particular one which makes us at the PyTables and Blosc teams very excited: optimized HDF5 hyper-slicing that leverages the double partition schema in Blosc2 NDim. This development was funded by a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`_ grant and the Blosc project.
