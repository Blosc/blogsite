It took a while to put things together, but after many months of hard work by maintainers, developers and contributors, `PyTables 3.10 <https://groups.google.com/g/pytables-users/c/XXXXTODOXXXX>`_ finally saw the light, full of `enhancements and fixes <https://www.pytables.org/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.10.x.html>`_.  Thanks to a `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`_ Small Development Grant, we were able to include a new feature that can help you squeeze considerable performance improvements when using compression: the direct chunking API.
