<p>I am an independent consultant and developer with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blosc.org/francesc-alted-resume.html">more than 15 years
of experience in Python and C programming languages</a>, and almost 25
years <a class="reference external" href="http://blosc.org/blog/compress-me-stupid.html">leveraging compression techniques for accelerating I/O</a>.  With customer
needs in mind I can apply my experience to help determining the best
options for handling and analyzing big datasets in the most efficient
way.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am the main author of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org">PyTables</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://bcolz.blosc.org/en/latest/">bcolz</a> as well as the ultra-fast <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blosc/c-blosc">Blosc</a> compressor that has become the
basis for some novel and innovative libraries in the I/O space.  In
particular, the bcolz project
provides a highly efficient way to perform out-of-core queries and computations on
column stored datasets that has become particularly interesting for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Blosc/movielens-bench/blob/master/querying-assp14.ipynb">analysis of medium/large-sized time-series datasets</a>.</p>
<p>What I offer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Development services on existing or new packages in the Blosc
ecosystem (including PyTables and bcolz).</li>
<li>Development services for custom software that is for doing optimal
I/O (either using Blosc/PyTables/bcolz or not).</li>
<li>Consulting services on better leveraging the Blosc ecosystem in your
own setups. Services like implementing new functionality, providing efficient
binaries or optimizing parameters for large streams of chunks are typical.</li>
</ul>
