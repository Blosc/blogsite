<p>Blosc is a <strong>high performance compressor optimized for binary
data</strong>. It has been designed to transmit data to the processor cache
faster than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch
approach via a <tt class="docutils literal">memcpy()</tt> OS call. Blosc is the first compressor (that
I'm aware of) that is meant not only to reduce the size of large
datasets on-disk or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound
computations (which is typical in vector-vector operations).</p>
<p>It uses the <strong>blocking technique</strong> (as described in this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blosc.org/docs/StarvingCPUs-CISE-2010.pdf">article</a>) to reduce
activity on the memory bus as much as possible.  In short, the
blocking technique works by dividing datasets in blocks that are small
enough to fit in L1 cache of modern processor and perform
compression/decompression there. It also leverages <em>SIMD</em> (SSE2)
and <em>multi-threading</em> capabilities present in nowadays multi-core
processors so as to accelerate the compression/decompression process
to a maximum.</p>

<div class="section" id="meta-compression-and-other-advantages-over-existing-compressors">
<h1>Meta-Compression And Other Advantages Over Existing Compressors</h1>
<p>Blosc is not like other compressors: it should rather be called a
<em>meta-compressor*</em>.  This is so because it can use different
compressors and pre-conditioners (programs that generally improve
compression ratio) under the hood.  At any rate, it can also be called
a compressor because it ships with its very own compressor and one
pre-conditioner, so that it can work in a standalone fashion.</p>
<p>Currently, Blosc uses <strong>BloscLZ</strong> by default, a compressor heavily
based on <a class="reference external" href="http://fastlz.org/">FastLZ</a>. From version 1.3 onwards,
Blosc also includes support for <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/lz4">LZ4 and LZ4HC</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/snappy">Snappy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zlib.net">Zlib</a>.  Also, it comes with a highly optimized (it
can use SSE2 instructions, if available) <strong>shuffle</strong> pre-conditioner.
Different compressors or pre-conditioners may be added in the future.</p>
<p>Blosc is in charge of coordinating the compressor and pre-conditioners
so that they can leverage the blocking technique (described above) as
well as multi-threaded execution (if several cores are available)
automatically. That makes that every compressor and pre-conditioner
will work at very high speeds, even if it was not initially designed
for doing blocking or multi-threading. For example, Blosc allows you
to use the classic <tt class="docutils literal">Zlib</tt> library, but in a multi-threaded mode.</p>
<p>Other advantages of Blosc are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Meant for binary data</strong>: can take advantage of the type size
meta-information for improved compression ratio (using the
integrated shuffle pre-conditioner).</li>
<li><strong>Small overhead on non-compressible data</strong>: only a maximum of (16
+ 4 * nthreads_used) additional bytes over the source buffer length
are needed to compress <em>every</em> input.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum destination length</strong>: contrarily to many other
compressors, both compression and decompression routines have
support for maximum size lengths for the destination buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement for memcpy()</strong>: it supports a 0 compression level that
does not compress at all and adds very little overhead.  In this
mode Blosc can even copy memory faster than a plain <cite>memcpy()</cite>
because it uses multi-threading.</li>
</ul>
<p>When taken together, all these features set Blosc apart from other
similar solutions.</p>

<div class="section" id="where-can-blosc-be-used">
<h1>Where Can Blosc Be Used?</h1>
<p>Blosc was initially developed for the needs of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org">PyTables</a> database and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Blosc/bcolz">bcolz</a> project, although it may be used
elsewhere where a fast compressor is needed.  Also, you may want to
use the new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Blosc/bloscpack">Bloscpack format and reference implementation</a> for much easier access to the
main Blosc features and benefits, also from the command line.</p>
<p>Applications using Blosc/Bloscpack are expected to allow I/O
performance to go beyond expected physical limits.  For example,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pytables.org">PyTables</a> benefits from Blosc for its
indexing and query operations in extremely large tables.  Even
in-memory computations can go faster in some cases as well (for
example, see <a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjimenezmateo/Big-Data/blob/master/Disk%20vs%20Memory,%20btable.ipynb">this IPython notebook</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-it-ready-for-production-use">
<h1>Is It Ready For Production Use?</h1>
<p>Yup, it is!</p>
<p>The PyTables community has contributed <a class="reference external" href="synthetic-benchmarks.html">testing Blosc very hard</a>, and I'm happy to say that, since 0.9.5 on,
it <strong>worked flawlessly compressing and decompressing hundreds of
Terabytes</strong> (coming from the <cite>hardsuite</cite> and <cite>extremesuite</cite> in the
included benchmark) on many different Windows and Unix boxes, both in
32-bit and 64-bit.  Of course, that does not mean that Blosc doesn't
contain bugs, but just that <strong>grave bugs are unlikely</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the introduction of Blosc 1.0, it has been declared
stable, and both the <strong>API and the format have been frozen</strong>, so you
should expect a large degree of stability for your Blosc-powered
applications.</p>
