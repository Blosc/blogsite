Professional Services by Francesc Alted
=======================================

I am an independent consultant and developer with `more than 25 years
of experience wrestling with Big Data in many different ways
<http://www.blosc.org/francesc-alted-resume/>`_, as well as
`leveraging compression techniques for accelerating I/O
<http://blosc.org/posts/compress-me-stupid/>`_.  With customer
needs in mind I can apply my experience to help determining the best
options for handling and analyzing big datasets in the most efficient
way.

As you may know, I am the main author of the ultra-fast `Blosc
<https://github.com/blosc/c-blosc>`_ compressor that has become the
basis for some novel and innovative libraries in the I/O space.  Also,
I have created projects like `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`_ and
`bcolz <http://bcolz.blosc.org/en/latest/>`_.  In particular, the bcolz project
provides a highly efficient way to perform out-of-core queries and computations on
column stored datasets that has become particularly interesting for the
`analysis of medium/large-sized time-series datasets
<https://github.com/Blosc/movielens-bench/blob/master/querying-assp14.ipynb>`_.

What I offer:

* Development services on existing or new packages in the Blosc
  ecosystem (including PyTables and bcolz).

* Development services for custom software that is for doing optimal
  I/O (either using Blosc/PyTables/bcolz or not).

* Consulting services on better leveraging the Blosc ecosystem in your
  own setups. Services like implementing new functionality, providing efficient
  binaries or optimizing parameters for large streams of chunks are typical.

* On-site training services about many aspects of Data Containers for Big Data and also Python.
  Look `here <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/Training-Next-Collaboration>`_
  for an example of my favourite topics.  I also did quite a bit of tutorials for conferences,
  like the one for `PyData Barcelona 2017 <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/PyData-BCN>`_
  or `Advanced Scientific Programming in Python in Reading, UK (2016)
  <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/ASPP-2016>`_.
