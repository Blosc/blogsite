Professional Services by Francesc Alted
=======================================

I am an independent consultant and developer with `more than 15 years
of experience in Python and C programming languages
<http://www.blosc.org/francesc-alted-resume.html>`_, and almost 25
years `leveraging compression techniques for accelerating I/O
<http://blosc.org/blog/compress-me-stupid.html>`_.  With customer
needs in mind I can apply my experience to help determining the best
options for handling and analyzing big datasets in the most efficient
way.

As you may know, I am the main author of `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`_, `bcolz <http://bcolz.blosc.org/en/latest/>`_ as well as the ultra-fast `Blosc
<https://github.com/blosc/c-blosc>`_ compressor that has become the
basis for some novel and innovative libraries in the I/O space.  In
particular, the bcolz project
provides a highly efficient way to perform out-of-core queries and computations on
column stored datasets that has become particularly interesting for the
`analysis of medium/large-sized time-series datasets
<https://github.com/Blosc/movielens-bench/blob/master/querying-assp14.ipynb>`_.

What I offer:

* Development services on existing or new packages in the Blosc
  ecosystem (including PyTables and bcolz).

* Development services for custom software that is for doing optimal
  I/O (either using Blosc/PyTables/bcolz or not).

* Consulting services on better leveraging the Blosc ecosystem in your
  own setups. Services like implementing new functionality, providing efficient
  binaries or optimizing parameters for large streams of chunks are typical.

For fees or any other inquiries, please send me a message at
francesc@blosc.org.
