Professional Services by Francesc Alted
=======================================

I am an independent consultant and developer with `more than 25 years
of experience wrestling with Big Data in many different ways
<https://www.blosc.org/francesc-alted-resume/>`_, as well as
`leveraging compression techniques for accelerating I/O
<http://blosc.org/posts/compress-me-stupid/>`_.  With customer
needs in mind I can apply my experience to help determining the best
options for handling and analyzing big datasets in the most efficient
way.

I am the author of the fast `Blosc <https://github.com/blosc/c-blosc>`_
compressor that has become the basis for some well known libraries like
HDF5 and Zarr.  Also, I have created projects like 
`PyTables <http://www.pytables.org>`_ and 
`Caterva <https://caterva.readthedocs.io/>`_ for storing and handling
extremely large amounts of data.

What I offer:

* Development services on existing or new packages in the Blosc
  ecosystem (including PyTables and bcolz).

* Development services for custom software that is for doing optimal
  I/O (either using Blosc/PyTables/bcolz or not).

* Consulting services on better leveraging the Blosc ecosystem in your
  own setups. Services like implementing new functionality, providing efficient
  binaries or optimizing parameters for large streams of chunks are typical.

* On-site training services about many aspects of Data Containers for Big Data and also Python.
  Look `here <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/Training-Next-Collaboration>`_
  for an example of my favourite topics.  I also did quite a bit of tutorials for conferences,
  like the one for `PyData Barcelona 2017 <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/PyData-BCN>`_
  or `Advanced Scientific Programming in Python in Reading, UK (2016)
  <https://github.com/FrancescAlted/ASPP-2016>`_.
